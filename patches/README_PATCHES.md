# TransitSNG - Compatibility & Enhancement Pack

This archive contains:
- The original project files (extracted).
- A `patches/` directory with recommended files to add and SQL migration scripts.
- A simple `requirements-postgres.txt` that adds PostgreSQL-related packages.
- A Dockerfile and `render.yaml` to help deploying to Render.com.

## What I checked (automated)
- Project extracted from `TransitSNG.zip`.
- Looked for common files: requirements, Dockerfile, admin files, templates, static.
  See `REPORT.md` for quick findings.

## Recommended next steps to make the project run on PostgreSQL and include the requested features
1. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r patches/requirements-postgres.txt`
2. **Database**: Set environment variable `DATABASE_URL` (example: `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname`)
3. **Apply DB migrations**: either use Alembic or run `patches/migrations_additions.sql` against your DB.
4. **Integrate admin blueprint**:
   - Copy `patches/admin_blueprint.py` into your app package.
   - Register the blueprint: `app.register_blueprint(admin_blueprint.admin_bp)`
   - Replace placeholder auth checks with your real authentication system.
5. **Tariffs / Cities grouping**:
   - After populating `tariffs` table, query with `WHERE starts_with = 'A'`.
   - Add frontend to allow editing and applying tariffs; see `patches/admin_blueprint.py` for endpoints skeleton.
6. **Main page**:
   - Ensure templates use a theme variable (e.g., `theme='dark'`) and that each module reads it.
   - Add 6-8 card placeholders in your main template. See `patches/ui_snippets.md` for HTML snippets.
7. **News and Vacancies**:
   - Use the `news` and `vacancies` tables. Add admin pages to create/update/publish them.
8. **Payments**:
   - Use `/admin/payments/summarize` endpoint skeleton to POST item arrays and receive summed totals.
9. **Deployment**:
   - Use provided Dockerfile and `patches/render.yaml`. Set environment variables on Render (DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY).
10. **Zip output**:
   - After integrating and testing locally, create a new zip for deployment.

## What I did NOT do (manual work required)
- I did not modify your original codebase in-place (no destructive edits).
- I created skeleton code, SQL, and deployment files that you need to integrate and test.
- Full end-to-end integration (auth ties, ORM model fields, templates wiring) requires manual mapping to your existing code structure.

## Where to go from here
- If you want, I can now attempt to automatically inject the admin blueprint and requirements into the project structure and run quick unit checks â€” but this can break if your project layout is non-standard. Tell me to proceed and I will patch the code directly and produce a runnable zip.
